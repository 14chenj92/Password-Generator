# Password-Generator

## Description

I developed a code for a random password generator. When a user visits the webpage, they can click on the generate password button to answer a series of prompts in order create a password. The first prompt is to choose a password length that ranges from 8 to 128 characters. The following questions confirm if the user wants the password to include lowercase, uppercase, numberic, or special characters. This tool is very helpful to create a secure password that users might utilize when they need to create login information. 

This image shows the code using the prompt and confirm commands.

This image shows how the final array is made by confirming or denying the password criteria in the confirm prompts.

This image shows how the final password is randomly generated by utilizing the password criteria and the password length.
